To be able to use a non-compatible realvnc client you have to downgrade the security of the realvnc server to use vnc password authentication. To be able to to this without a desktop connection open a SSH session:

    Edit the config file in /root/.vnc/config.d/vncserver-x11

    Add the following lines at the end of the file

    Authentication=VncAuth
    Encryption=AlwaysOff
    Password=e0fd0472492935da

    Restart the server

This will set the authentication with the password: foobar. In order to change the password,

vncpasswd -service
